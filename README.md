# xymon-plugins

Collection of optional plugins and extensions for [Xymon](https://xymon.sourceforge.io/) monitoring. Includes community-contributed checks, integrations, and add-ons that extend Xymon client functionality. Each plugin lives in its own directory with a README covering installation, configuration, and usage.

Provided on a best-effort basis. Tested on RHEL/CentOS/AlmaLinux 9.

## Quick start

Each plugin directory contains:
- The plugin script(s)
- A `*.cfg` file for `clientlaunch.cfg` (or `clientlaunch.d/`)
- A `README.md` with full installation and configuration details

General steps for any plugin:

```bash
cp <plugin>/<script> $XYMONCLIENTHOME/ext/
chmod +x $XYMONCLIENTHOME/ext/<script>
cp <plugin>/<plugin>.cfg $XYMONCLIENTHOME/etc/clientlaunch.d/
# edit the CMD line in the .cfg to match your environment
systemctl reload xymon-client   # or kill -HUP the xymonlaunch process
```

## Xymon environment variables

All plugins expect the standard Xymon client environment sourced from `xymonclient.cfg`:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `$XYMON` | Full path to the `xymon` binary |
| `$XYMSRV` | Xymon server address |
| `$MACHINE` | This host's Xymon machine name (dots replaced with commas) |
| `$XYMONCLIENTHOME` | Xymon client install root |
| `$XYMONTMP` | Temp directory for Xymon client |
